KNOWN BUGS:
- There may be errors in the Max Window when initializing or reinitializing. Some of these errors concern graphics files that the program is having trouble loading. Some errors are thrown as the program/patch is being loaded. No errors should appear when the "Initialize this Corpus" button is clicked.
- There is a meaningless error every time a new file is imported for segmentation.
- Not every module has its full advertised functionality, some parameters have no effect and are there as placeholders for features yet to be implemented. Often these inactive parameters are italicized.
