KNOWN BUGS:
- there may be errors in the Max Window when initializing or reinitializing; clicking the list of descriptors messages near the bottom of the patch before initializing should minimize the number of errors.
- not every module has its full advertised functionality, some parameters have no effect and are there as placeholders for features yet to be implemented.
