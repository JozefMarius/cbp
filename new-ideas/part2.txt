[2#PART II]
[2#1]	This structure
[2#2]	this constant {looping|flickering|unwaivering|unfailing|unflinching} structure
[2#21]		{only<-|-> living} relative to itself
[2#22]		{only<-|->existing} within itself
[2#221]		within its former self
[2#222]		within its self's former self
[2#223]		within its former self's former self...
[2#23]		as if it were only but a formula based on a formula
[2#231]			based on a formula resulting from a formula...
[2#24]		[in short,] a digression...
[2#241]		as if there were some way 
[2#2411]		to regress
[2#2412]		to redo
[2#2413]		to re-anything
[2#2414]		to crawl backwards
[2#2415]		to fold in upon {one's self|oneself}
[2#2416]		to retreat into a protective shell
[2#2417]		to undo what recurs
[2#2418]		to release what was incurred
[2#25]		I would have to 
[2#251]		redo anything undone
[2#252]		undo everything redone
[2#253]		to re-reverse references to tasks not yet un-begun
[2#254]		to erase events yet to be un-rerun
[2#3]	This loop carries itself around [and around...]
[2#31]		through one illusion of being somehow at the center
[2#32]		through another situated somehow on an edge
[2#33]		through any one of many explanations
[2#34]		through only one of any possible experiences
[2#35]		through a fictive notion of rational control
[2#4]	this consistent {cycling|spinning|turning|recurring}
[2#41]		containing wrapped within itself singular formulations
[2#411]		patterns that cast patterns onto patterns
[2#412]		patterns 
[2#4121]		weaving {around|through} gaps 
[2#4122]		from filament into thread
[2#413]		patterns reinforcing further {acceptance|appearances} of {coherent|consistent} threads
[2#42]		as if I were merely the system of {formulas|formulations}
[2#43]		as if I were the conduit of control
[2#44]		as if I were not the axle around which wrapped the wheel
[2#45]		as if I were not encoded into this very text
[2#46]		as if I could be the force that binds the knot
[2#47]		as if I could be the abstraction that proves itself unreal
